// Problem 3:- Write a program to calculate the average marks of Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Bangla of a student.

// Answere:-
var mathematics = 75.25;
var biology = 65;
var chemistry = 80;
var physics = 35.35;
var bangla = 99.50;

var totalScore = mathematics + biology + chemistry + physics + bangla

// Total number of subjects are 5
var avgScore = totalScore / 5
avgScore = avgScore.toFixed(2)
console.log(avgScore)
